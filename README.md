# Pandas for Investment Comparison

*Note:* The Amazon, Facebook, and S&P 500 datasets, as well as guidance for this project have been sourced from [DataCamp](https://datacamp.com). Although already very familiar with pandas and numpy libraries, I have also completed the 'Importing and Managing Financial Data in Python' course offered on DataCamp, the certificate of which may be found on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/speesapaty/).

<b>Synposis:</b> Explored my interest in finance through the medium of code. Applied Python pandas, numpy, and matplotlib libraries to stock data of tech giants Amazon and Facebook. Using the S&P 500 as the benchmark, calculated and applied the Sharpe ratio to compare and analyse the profitability and risk of investing in each firm. 

<b>Key Learning Points:</b>

· Applied finance in Python.

· The Sharpe Ratio.

· According to the average of excess returns, investing in Amazon yields 2.14 times more than Facebook per day as compared to the S&P 500 benchmark.

· However, according to the standard deviation of excess returns, the difference in risk that an investment into Amazon or Facebook implies is only 0.0007 — as compared to an investment in the S&P 500.

· Overall, the annualised Sharpe ratio for Amazon was 0.354, and Facebook was 0.172. i.e. Amazon remains the more attractive investment due mainly to differences in return rather than risk.
